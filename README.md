# Real Time Bus Tracker üìçüöå

## Description:

The Real-Time Bus Tracker was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and also, we are using two different APIs. Mapbox API is used to create the map, and the MBTA API is used to get real-time data to track the buses within a route.

## How to run:

‚Ä¢ Clone the respository to your computer
‚Ä¢ Sign up for https://www.mapbox.com and create a developer API Key
‚Ä¢ Add you API Key to the mapanimation.js file
‚Ä¢ Click on the button and start tracking the busses on real time!
‚Ä¢ Watch as much busses as you want! =D

‚Ä¢ Another way to run it is just visiting the live demo and trying it out!

## Roadmap of future improvements:

‚Ä¢ Add a a pop up to see more real time data
‚Ä¢ Change Colors of the markers
